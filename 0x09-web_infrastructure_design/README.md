# Web Infrastructure Design

This project is a collection of web infrastructure designs that could be implemented in any web development project. Each design illustrates the components and connections involved in creating a scalable, secure, and reliable web application.

## Designs Presented

* [Simple web stack]() - A basic web infrastructure design that consists of a single server, a load balancer, and a database.
* [Distributed web infrastructure](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1#G1Pzzqk4sLhenOU8FjjR_53Qmfoq6VIiPA) - A web infrastructure design that distributes the load across multiple servers, using a load balancer and a master-slave database replication.
* [Secured and monitored web infrastructure]() - A web infrastructure design that adds security and monitoring features to the distributed web infrastructure, such as firewalls, SSL certificates, and health checks.
* [Scaled up web infrastructure](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1#G1DB-D5sCs2FAV3GRPAgS5lQ_F0NP-xjry) - A web infrastructure design that scales up the web application to handle more traffic and data, using a CDN, caching, and sharding.

## Built With

* [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) - The web-based diagramming tool used to create the designs
* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - The lightweight markup language used to write this README.md file
